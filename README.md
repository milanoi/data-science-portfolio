**Causal Inference(using R, Python)**

Using statistics to prove empirically a causal relationship, and calculating the true treatment effect.

1. Statistical matching:

Ensuring that the treatment and control group are similar pre-treatment
Minimizing the effect of unaccounted variables (i.e., confounding variables)

2. Counterfactuals:

Using statistics to estimate the result of being assigned to the opposite group
Calculating the true treatment effect

3. Multicollinearity, endogeneity:

Accounting for the possibility of variables and/or the error being correlated with each other

4. Hypothesis testing:

RCTs, ANOVA, T-test, Fisher's test of independence, $\chi^{2}$ test, p-values


**Machine Learning (using Python)**

Collecting and processing data to build all kinds of machine learning models.

1. Classification:

Logistic regression, KNN, SVM, random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks

2. Regression:

Linear & multiple regression, random forest, lasso & ridge regression, neural networks

3. Clustering:

K-means clustering, fuzzy clustering, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering

4. Dimensionality reduction:

Principal component analysis, singular value decomposition, linear discriminant analysis

5. Deep Learning:
